<h1>INFM 600</h1>
These are 3 datasets created for the INFM 600 course Information Organization assignment.

Version
Version 1.0 (October 2015)

Datasets:
I have primarily used 3 datasets in this assignment.

1. Historic_Sites_View.csv
The Historic_Sites_View data is my focal dataset. The reason for me choosing this dataset as opposed to a dataset that is 
directly related to our project is, the size of the data. The number of records in this particular dataset are sufficient 
enough to create an effective analysis. This dataset gives us information about the Historic sites in the Howard county.
Variables like name of the building, address, location, geometric coordinates allow the user to ask the following questions
of the dataset,
        1. Which areas in HoCo are dominated by historic sites?
        2. What is the location wise distribution of historic sites in HoCo? 
        
2. Historic_Districts.csv
Historic districts dataset gives the user an idea about the districts where the historic site locations are placed. 
This is a relatively small dataset as it contains only 2 districts. The questions that it can help answer could be,
        1. Which areas predominantly have a historic district?
        
3. Historic_Mile_Markers.csv
Historic mile markers dataset gives the user an idea about the location of the mile markers using factors like road names, historic routes, mile number at which the mile marker occurs. The kind of questions this dataset would allow user to answer are,
        1. Density of mile markers in a particular area?
        
Analysis after combination of datasets
If we were to combine Historic_Mile_Makers.csv and Historic_Districts.csv files then, based on the resulting dataset, 
we could answer the following question,
        1. What is the distribution of the mile makers across different districts?
        Such a question can be best answered using a geo-spatial data visualization which could be attained using Tableau. 

If we were to combine the Historic_Districts.csv and Historic_Sites_View.csv then, based on the resulting dataset, we could 
answer the following question,
        1. What is the distribution of the historic sites across different districts?
        Such a question can also be answered using a geo-spatial visualization which could be attained using Tableau.
